# MyPandaPal

- MyPandaPal developed by ERIC Zhou from University of Toronto with three teammates Sophie Luo, Edwin Or and Dylan Sta Ana from Western University during QHack from 2023 Jan 27-29 at Queens University. It is an Chrome extension that features real-time notifications when it's time for busy university student to eat, drink, sleep or exercise by motivating students to take care of their pets and in turn, themselves to prevent burnout and take on a healthier lifestyle .

## More Details about the project:

- As busy university students trying to balance the stress of attending back-to- back classes, keeping up with coursework, attending a lot of meetings, and juggling a whole lot of extracurriculars, it can be easy to forget about healthy habits such as sitting down to eat a meal, drinking water, and sleeping enough hours. We've all been there and have had classes starting at 8am in the morning and meetings ending at 9pm at night, resulting in us completely losing track of our appetite!

- Chrome Extension that features real-time notifications when it's time to eat/drink/sleep/exercise! Every user would have their Pet Panda to take care of, which represents themselves and displays a different mood based on the personalized status of healthy habits. Users can press the appropriate button for whichever action they just performed (e.g. eating or drinking) and this would update the mood of the Panda accordingly! If the Panda goes too long without one of the four healthy habits, they would die! Thus, MyPandaPal would essentially be a gamified habit tracker that motivates users to take care of their pets and in turn, themselves to prevent burnout and take on a healthier lifestyle.
